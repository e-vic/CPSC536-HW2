The final Jupyter Notebook is called A2-final.ipynb. The report is called HOMEWORK2_REPORT. The two files that look like pointillism are the output of 3000 iterations of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm when we weren't using the wavelet transform (and were restricting the domain of the images to have 1-norm less than tau). Although they're not *really* correct, they look cool and show the evolution of our implementation!
